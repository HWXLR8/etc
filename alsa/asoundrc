# assume "dsp0" as default name for PCM and "mixer0" for CTL.

# Amazingly, XMMS has problems if one defines 'pcm.dsp0' to be
# 'plug' for 'pcm.asym0' and not directly as 'asym0'.

# Buffering (period time defaults to 125000 usecs).

# Size of period, expressed either in usec or byte units:
#   period_time USECS
#   period_size BYTES

# Size of buffers, expressed either in period, usec, or byte units:
#   periods     PERIODS
#   buffer_time USECS
#   buffer_size BYTES

# The ALSA docs have examples with 'period_time' set to 0,
# when 'period_size' and 'buffer_size' are used instead,
# but this can cause trouble in later releases of ALSA.

# For OSS compatibility, 'period_size' and 'buffer_size'
# should be powers of 2. Also, many cards cannot accept
# a 'period_size' much greater than 4096, so 4096 is safe.
# On my VIA 8233A, any value for 'period_time' greater than
# 85333 usecs (precisely!) causes hiccups in sound output.
# Why? At 48kHz, 85333 usec are are just over 4096 bytes/channel.
